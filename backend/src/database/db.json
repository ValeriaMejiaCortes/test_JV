      "text": "IKEA is a Scandanavian furniture chain with stores around the world. They are, in their own words, taking ambitious steps towards a more sustainable future. One of their LinkedIn posts that performed well was about their goal to serve a 50% plant-based  menu by 2025. Which is interesting, as it has little to do with their main product (furniture and home accessories). But it makes  sense when you think about it. You can find a restaurant in  almost every IKEA store and they also sell food products that people can take home. And sustainability is becoming a serious factor in people’s considerations to buy somewhere. This post shows us that a lot of IKEA followers respond well to this focus on sustainability.",

      "text": "Bettys is a local tearoom with a few locations in Yorkshire, an area in northern England. They’re quite famous around these parts and Bettys has been around for more than 100 years. A few weeks back, they shared a post on Facebook with a link to a video on the BBC website. In this video, Nadiya and Fred (who you can often see on the BBC) visit and eat at Bettys. As you can see, the post got a lot of likes and comments.",
